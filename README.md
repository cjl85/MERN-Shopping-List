# MERN-Shopping-List

This is a shopping list built with the MERN stack - (Mongodb, Express, React, and Node) with Redux for state management.

Reactstrap and React-Transition-Group was also used for the layout (buttons, toggling, color, etc) as well as for entering 
and exiting transititons for components.
