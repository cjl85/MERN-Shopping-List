# MERN-Shopping-List

This is a shopping list built with the MERN stack - (Mongodb - database, Express - framework, React - frontend, and Node - server-side) with Redux for state management.

Reactstrap and React-Transition-Group were also used for the layout (buttons, toggling, color, etc) as well as for entering 
and exiting transititons for components.

To get started, please `git clone` the repository and be sure to `npm install` as well to account for the missing `node_modules`. Also be sure to add your `MONGO_URI` to the default.json file. Make sure you set an env variable and the jwtSecret on deployment as well. 

Use 'npm run dev' after installing 'concurrently' to run both the client and server at the same time.
